        JavaScript supports a variety of events that can be triggered when interacting with an HTML document. Here are some common types of events:
        
        Mouse Events:
        
        
        click: Fires when the user clicks an element.
        dblclick: Fires when the user double-clicks an element.
        mousedown, mouseup: Fire when the user presses or releases a mouse button over an element.
        mousemove: Fires when the user moves the mouse pointer over an element.
        Keyboard Events:
        
        keydown, keyup: Fire when a keyboard key is pressed or released while the element has focus.
        keypress: Fires when a keyboard key is pressed, but not for non-printable keys.
        Form Events:
        
        submit: Fires when a form is submitted.
        reset: Fires when a form is reset.
        change: Fires when the value of an input element changes (e.g., in textboxes, checkboxes, and select elements).
    Focus Events:
    
    focus, blur: Fire when an element gains or loses focus.
    Window Events:
    
    load: Fires when a page has finished loading.
    unload: Fires when a page is unloading (usually when navigating away from the page).
    resize: Fires when the browser window is resized.
    scroll: Fires when the user scrolls the page.
    Document Events:
    
    DOMContentLoaded: Fires when the HTML document has been completely loaded and parsed, without waiting for stylesheets, images, and subframes to finish loading.
    Input Events:
    
    input: Fires when the value of an input element changes. It's similar to the change event but fires immediately as the user types.
    Touch Events (for mobile devices):
    
    touchstart, touchmove, touchend: Fire when a touch event starts, moves, or ends.
