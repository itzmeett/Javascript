        <div class="question">
            50. What is the drawback of declaring methods directly in JavaScript objects?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            <p>It creates a new instance of the function object for each instance of the object, which can be memory inefficient</p>
            <p>It binds the scope of the constructor to each function, which can prevent garbage collection of the constructor arguments</p>
            <p>It cannot access the prototype chain of the object, which can limit the inheritance and modification of the methods</p>
            <p>A better alternative is to use the prototype property of the object to declare methods, which can save memory, improve performance, and enable inheritance</p>
