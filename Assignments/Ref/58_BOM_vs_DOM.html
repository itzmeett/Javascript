        1. DOM (Document Object Model):

        Purpose: The DOM represents the structure of an HTML or XML document as a tree-like 
        structure. It provides a way for programs (such as JavaScript) to manipulate the con
        tent, structure, and style of a document dynamically.
        

        Usage: Developers commonly use the DOM to access, modify, add, or delete elements an
        d attributes within an HTML document. It allows scripts to interact with the content
         of a webpage and dynamically update the user interface.


        2. BOM (Browser Object Model):



        Purpose: The BOM represents various components of the browser, excluding the documen
        t itself. It provides objects and interfaces for interacting with the browser environ
        ment, such as manipulating the browser window, managing history, handling cookies, and
         more.
        

        Usage: Developers use the BOM to perform actions related to the browser, such as ope
        ning new windows, resizing windows, navigating history, and detecting the user's brows
        er and screen properties.
