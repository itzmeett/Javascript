        Purpose: The BOM represents various components of the browser, excluding the documen
        t itself. It provides objects and interfaces for interacting with the browser environ
        ment, such as manipulating the browser window, managing history, handling cookies, and
         more.
        

        Usage: Developers use the BOM to perform actions related to the browser, such as ope
        ning new windows, resizing windows, navigating history, and detecting the user's brows
        er and screen properties.
