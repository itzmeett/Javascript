            <h3>What is "Undeclared"?</h3>
            <p>When a variable is "undeclared", it means that it has not been declared or defined in the current scope. </p>
            <p>it means, it hasn't been given a value or a type. </p>
            <p> This can happen if you try to use a variable without declaring it first, or if you misspell the variable
                name.</p>

/* This code will not throw an error because the variable "x" is declared, 
even though it has not been initialized with a value */

            <h3>What is "Undefined"?</h3>
            <p>Unlike "undeclared" variables, "undefined" variables have been declared in the current scope, but have not been given a value. </p>
            <p>In other words, they have been initialized, but their value is not defined.</p>
